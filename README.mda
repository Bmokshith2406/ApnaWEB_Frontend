Vision of ApnaWEB:
Our Company's Vision is Grounded in the Historical Evolution of Job Application Methods. In the Past, Individuals Relied on References, Letters of Introduction, and Word of Mouth to Secure Employment. However, as the Mid-20th Century Unfolded, the Use of Resumes and CVs Became the Gold Standard for Job Applications, Providing a More Structured and Comprehensive Way to Showcase Qualifications. We Strongly Believe That Now is the Opportune Moment for Another Transformative Shift in This Evolution. We Envision a Future Where Individuals Move Away from Traditional Resumes and CVs and Instead Embrace Personal Web Pages and Websites to Approach Different Companies. This Transition Will Empower Individuals to Present Themselves More Dynamically and Creatively, Showcasing Their Skills and Experiences in a Way That is Engaging and Impactful.
